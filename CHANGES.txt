4.0.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- Replaced deprecated ``zope.component.adapts`` usage with equivalent
  ``zope.component.adapter`` decorator.

- Replaced deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent
  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.

- Dropped support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.


3.7.2 (2010-05-25)
------------------

- Fixed unit tests broken under Python 2.4 by the switch to the standard
  library ``doctest`` module.


3.7.1 (2010-04-30)
------------------

- Prefer the standard library's ``doctest`` module to the one from
  ``zope.testing.``


3.7 (2010-04-27)
----------------

- Since ``tales:expressiontype`` is now in ``zope.browserpage``, update
  conditional ZCML accordingly so it doesn't depend on the presence of
  ``zope.app.pagetemplate`` anymore.


3.6.1 (2009-12-23)
------------------

- Ensure that our ``configure.zcml`` can be loaded without requiring further
  dependencies. It uses a ``tales:expressiontype`` directive defined in
  ``zope.app.pagetemplate.`` We keep that dependency optional, as not all
  consumers of this package use ZCML to configure the expression type.


3.6.0 (2009-12-22)
------------------

- Updated test dependency to use ``zope.browserpage``.


3.5.0 (2009-03-18)
------------------

- Add very simple, but useful base class for implementing content
  providers, see ``zope.contentprovider.provider.ContentProviderBase``.

- Remove unneeded testing dependencies. We only need ``zope.testing`` and
  ``zope.app.pagetemplate``.

- Remove zcml slug and old zpkg-related files.

- Added setuptools dependency to setup.py.

- Clean up package's description and documentation a bit. Remove
  duplicate text in README.

- Change mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead of
  retired one.

- Change ``cheeseshop`` to ``pypi`` in the package url.


3.4.0 (2007-10-02)
------------------

- Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.
